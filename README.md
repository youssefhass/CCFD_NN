Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_FYP is a final year project completed by Youssef that investigates the application of deep mining and machine learning techniques for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The project aims to identify potential solutions for accurately detecting fraudulent activity.

The dataset used for this project is comprised of two classes: 0 (non-fraudulent) and 1 (fraudulent). It includes transaction amount information, as well as anonymous numerical features labeled V1 through V28. These features are the result of PCA transformation and have been anonymized to protect confidentiality. Additionally, the dataset includes a time variable that measures the amount of time elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction recorded in the dataset.
